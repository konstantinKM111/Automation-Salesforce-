Salesforce Automation Project Setup Instructions
Overview: This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up an automated testing environment for Salesforce applications using Java, Selenium, Cucumber, JUnit, and IntelliJ IDEA. 
The project leverages Maven for dependency management and follows best practices in behavior-driven development (BDD) and data-driven testing (DDT).
Required Tools:
1.	Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure the latest JDK is installed.
2.	IntelliJ IDEA: Download and install the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.
3.	Maven: Install Maven for project dependency management.
4.	WebDriver: Download the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) for your browser.
Setup Instructions:
1.	Clone the Repository:
*	Clone the project repository from GitHub using the command:
git clone <repository_url>
2.	Import the Project into IntelliJ IDEA:
*	Open IntelliJ IDEA and select File -> Open.
*	Navigate to the cloned repository directory and select the pom.xml file.
*	Click Open to import the project. IntelliJ IDEA will automatically detect and import Maven dependencies.
3.	Install Dependencies:
*	IntelliJ IDEA will prompt you to import Maven projects. Accept the prompt to install all dependencies.
*	Alternatively, open the terminal in IntelliJ IDEA and run:
mvn clean install
4.	Configure WebDriver:
*	Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome).
*	Set up the WebDriver path in the src/test/resources/config.properties file:
webdriver.chrome.driver=path/to/chromedriver
*	Ensure the WebDriver binary has executable permissions.

5.	Set Up Configuration Properties:
*	Modify src/test/resources/config.properties to include necessary configurations such as URLs, login credentials, and other environment-specific settings.
6.	Running Tests:
*	Navigate to the test runner class (e.g., CukesRunner.java) or individual feature files.
*	Right-click on the file and select Run to execute the tests within IntelliJ IDEA.
*	Ensure the Salesforce sandbox environment is set up and accessible.
7.	Viewing Reports:
*	After test execution, view the generated reports in the target/cucumber-reports directory.
*	These reports provide detailed insights into the test execution results and help in analyzing the test outcomes.
Project Structure:
*	Java Programming Language: Utilized for writing test logic and implementing automation scripts.
*	Cucumber (BDD, DDT): Implements Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Data-Driven Testing (DDT) methodologies, defining scenarios in Gherkin syntax.
*	Selenium WebDriver: Automates browser interactions to test Salesforce application functionalities.
*	JUnit: Framework for unit testing, ensuring code reliability and functionality validation.
*	IntelliJ IDEA: Integrated Development Environment used for efficient code editing, debugging, and project management.
*	Maven (POM.xml): Manages project dependencies, facilitates build automation, and ensures consistency across development environments.
*	Feature Files: Define behavior-driven scenarios using Gherkin syntax, detailing test steps and expected outcomes.
*	Step Definitions: Java methods interpreting Gherkin steps, invoking Selenium WebDriver actions to interact with Salesforce.
*	Pages Files: Encapsulate Salesforce page elements and methods for reusable interactions, enhancing test maintainability.
*	Hook Class: Executes pre- and post-test actions (e.g., setup and teardown), managing WebDriver initialization and closure, and facilitating test environment setup.
*	Runner Class: Orchestrates test execution, integrates Cucumber with JUnit for automation, configures plugins for comprehensive reporting.
*	Utilities (e.g., BrowserUtils): Provide helper methods for WebDriver management, ensuring efficient browser handling during tests.
*	Configuration Properties: Centralize test environment configurations, like URLs or credentials, enhancing flexibility and security.
*	POM.xml: Maven project descriptor, manages dependencies (e.g., Selenium WebDriver), facilitates build automation and project lifecycle management.
Final Notes:
*	Ensure that all environment-specific configurations are correctly set in the configuration properties file.
*	Regularly update WebDriver binaries to match the browser versions used for testing.
*	Utilize IntelliJ IDEA’s debugging tools to troubleshoot any issues during test execution.
