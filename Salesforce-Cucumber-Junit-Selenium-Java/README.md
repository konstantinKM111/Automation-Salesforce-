Java Programming Language: Utilized for writing test logic and implementing automation scripts.

Cucumber (BDD, DDT): Implements Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Data-Driven Testing (DDT) methodologies, defining scenarios in Gherkin syntax.

Selenium WebDriver: Automates browser interactions to test Salesforce application functionalities.

JUnit: Framework for unit testing, ensuring code reliability and functionality validation.

IntelliJ IDEA: Integrated Development Environment used for efficient code editing, debugging, and project management.

Maven (POM.xml) built automation tool: Manages project dependencies, facilitates build automation, and ensures consistency across development environments.

Feature Files: Define behavior-driven scenarios using Gherkin syntax, detailing test steps and expected outcomes.

Step Definitions: Java methods interpreting Gherkin steps, invoking Selenium WebDriver actions to interact with Salesforce.

Pages Files: Encapsulate Salesforce page elements and methods for reusable interactions, enhancing test maintainability.

Hook Class: Executes pre- and post-test actions (e.g., setup and teardown), managing WebDriver initialization and closure, and facilitating test environment setup.

Runner Class: Orchestrates test execution, integrates Cucumber with JUnit for automation, configures plugins for comprehensive reporting.

Utilities (e.g., BrowserUtils): Provide helper methods for WebDriver management, ensuring efficient browser handling during tests.

Configuration Properties: Centralize test environment configurations, like URLs or credentials, enhancing flexibility and security.

POM.xml: Maven project descriptor, manages dependencies (e.g., Selenium WebDriver), facilitates build automation and project lifecycle management.

This setup combines Java's robust programming capabilities with Cucumber's BDD/DDT frameworks, Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, 
JUnit for unit testing, and IntelliJ IDEA with Maven for streamlined development and dependency management.
